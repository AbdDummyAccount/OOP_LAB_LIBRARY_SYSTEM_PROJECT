# OOP_LAB_LIBRARY_SYSTEM_PROJECT
This code simulates a library system with books, employees, customers, and transactions, each with a specific password to access their data.
It uses password-based input to display different sections of the system based on user role (book, employee, customer, transaction).
Object-oriented programming concepts are applied, including inheritance, inner classes, encapsulation, overloading, and overriding.
The review class adds a rating system for the library, while the notification class handles user alerts.
The childL class uses multiple inheritance and overrides the display function, adding location and working hours information.
