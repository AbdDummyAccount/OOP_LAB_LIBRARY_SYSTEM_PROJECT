# OOP_LAB_LIBRARY_SYSTEM_PROJECT
Our project is a simple library system using OOP concepts like structs, classes, inner classes, all types of inheritance, and polymorphism (overloading &amp; overriding), along with loops and logic operations. It applies lab concepts in a practical way and helped improve our coding skills.
